Encouraging banks and credit unions to offer small credit options makes sense because they are federally regulated entities that can make such loans at prices that are at least six times lower than payday loans, which will probably continue to exist in the years ahead. Traditional financial institutions have significant competitive advantages over payday lenders, including large existing branch networks, diversified product lines, existing relationships with borrowers, and the lowest cost of funds in the industry. By contrast, nonbank lenders incur substantial costs that they must cover from revenue on a narrow line of products. Storefront payday lenders spend two-thirds of their revenue on overhead, and customer acquisition and defaults are major cost drivers for online lenders.
