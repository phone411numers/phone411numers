Most people who use payday and similar loans live paycheck to paycheck, have damaged credit profiles, and frequently have trouble paying their monthly bills. They also tend to have volatile income that fluctuates by more than 25 percent from month to month (think of those who earn hourly wages at jobs with unpredictable schedules). This helps explain why 7 in 10 borrowers say they use payday loans mainly for recurring expenses such as rent, mortgage, and utilities. Borrowing cannot solve fundamental problems, including low wages or poor financial planning, but affordable, fairly structured small installment loans can help bridge gaps in the budgets of these vulnerable consumers. Banks and credit unions could play a large role in ensuring access to such safe small credit, but only if regulators provide guidelines that are clear and simple.
