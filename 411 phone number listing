Payday loan borrowers are worthy candidates for loans from traditional financial institutions because they are already bank or credit union customers. (To get payday loans, consumers must have checking accounts.) Yet millions of them go outside their financial institutions to access small amounts of credit, spending roughly $9 billion on payday loans and $3 billion on auto title loans each year. The availability of lower-cost credit from traditional financial institutions could save these consumers more than $10 billion annually, help them to improve their credit scores, and give them access to safer, more affordable products. These loans would also provide an alternative to costly overdrafts: Unlike a $35 fee for an overdraft, a $35 fee for a $300 installment loan looks like a fair deal to most Americans.
